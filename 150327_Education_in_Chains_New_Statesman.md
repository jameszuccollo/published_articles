I wonder if you might be interested in a piece suggesting that academy school chains are the future of the education system? We are releasing a report tomorrow (press release below and embargoed report attached), which suggests schools could save, on average, Â£50-100,000 each in administrative costs, if they were to join large school chains. I hope it provides a useful counterpoint to the increasingly common idea that only the quality of our teaching staff matters.
 
The piece would argue that the move to academy schools provides autonomy without direction. Individual academies often suffer the administrative costs of being a small business and do not have the time or expertise to grow, and to improve the quality of education they provide. They would benefit from the economies of scale, clarity of governance, and quality of management that larger organisations can provide. To realise those benefits, and provide a better education for their students at a lower cost to the taxpayer, they should be encouraged to join large school chains with strong corporate centres. Chains have picked up a bad reputation in the UK with notable failures among those that grew too fast for their corporate centres to manage. But, overseas, chains of over 100 schools in countries as diverse as the US, Turkey, and the Philippines, demonstrate the potential of the model.

England's schools are good, but not great: we are mid-pack in international comparisons of developed nations. Our students have good skills, but not great: a Japanese secondary school graduate's literacy and numeracy matches an English university graduate's. More worryingly, our education system appears to be slipping further behind our international competitors'.

For the past decade, the answer has been to take power from bureaucrats and give it to schools and teachers. The academy programme instigated by Andrew Adonis in 2000, and accelerated by the Coalition Government, has freed nearly 5000 state-funded schools from the control of local authorities. These academies are able to set their own term times, alter teachers' pay, employ unqualified teachers, manage their own finances, and devise their own curricula. 

The hope was that giving schools the freedom to innovate would enable them to find ways to improve the quality of their education. The truth is that academies have not been as innovative as hoped. The best schools have thrived on the increased autonomy, but they are a minority. Only a third of academies have departed from the National Curriculum, or changed teachers' contracts. Fewer than a fifth have altered the school day, and less than 10 per cent have altered term times. What is certain is that school leaders now spend more time on administration because they are not just running a school any more: they are running a small business.

For the academy programme to succeed it must not just grant freedom to schools, but enable them to take advantage of it. Highly successful small businesses need outstanding governance at the board level to hold the organisation to account. Schools have boards of volunteer governors who rarely have the skills required to put head teachers under the microscope. They need a professional management team who can handle the finances, inspire staff, and set a strategic direction for the organisation. They need educationalists, dedicated to pioneering new approaches and embedding the ones that work across the organisation.

These problems are not unique to schools, nor are they the fault of the people running them: they are endemic to small organisations, where there is not the capacity to invest in such luxuries. Only large organisations have the scale to invest in the research and testing that innovation requires. Unfortunately, 84 per cent of academies are either standalone schools or belong to a group of 10 schools or less. Only 7 per cent are in large groups of over 30 schools. 

Even in those larger groups, the corporate centre usually gets only about 4 per cent of funding. Many successful companies invest 8 to 10 per cent at the centre. That spending enables the organisation to professionalise governance and management, and invest in innovation to improve quality across all business units. If academies are to take advantage of their freedoms they must learn from successful businesses in other fields and take advantage of the economies of scale that larger organisations allow.
